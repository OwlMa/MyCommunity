# SQL
-if we set default in the sql schema, then it is better not to insert any value
into the table while creating this record, even "" is not working and may lead to
null in the database.

# Postman
- If we want to make postman hold the same session with client(browser), we need to use
the APP of postman, and enable the cookie tracer function in postman. Furthermore, add the 
session id and the token to the cookie in postman.
